            <h1 class="centerText">About Cloud9</h1>
            <p>Cloud9 came into the North America League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS) in the summer of 2013. The organization had an iconic entrance into the scene by going a total of 30-3 across the regular season and playoffs – good for a 93% win rate. Cloud9 proved that their early success was not a flash in the pan by going on to become one of the most successful organizations in esports. Since 2013, Cloud9 has won a domestic title 2 times, placed second 6 times, and placed third 1 time. While they have seen great success domestically, the team’s claim-to-fame is their performances on the international stage.</p>
            <p>The organization often finds itself in the envious position of being “North America’s last hope” when it comes to the League of Legends World Championship, the game’s most prestigious tournament. In 2018, they had the most impressive showing of any North American team ever when they made the semifinals at the League of Legends World Championship. The team defeated a Korean team that goes by the name of “Afreeca Freecs” in a best of five series; not only did C9 do the unthinkable in winning a best of five series against a Korean team, but they even took the series in a clean sweep!</p>
            <p>This year is the first year in which none of the original Cloud9 members from the 2013 season are on the roster. After being a franchise roster since the organization’s founding, the beloved ADC Zachary “Sneaky” Scuderi found himself without a starting position on the team after a poor 2019 season. The organization decided to go in a different direction and build around a cornerstone piece in top laner Eric “Licorice” Ritchie going into the 2020 season. The 2020 offseason was a tumultuous one for many Cloud9 fans as Sneaky had been a fan favorite for many years due to his eccentric personality and fun cosplays. Not only that, but the team decided to trade away the 2019 LCS Summer Split MVP Dennis “Svenskeren” Johnsen and support Tristan “Zeyzal” Stidam for cash considerations. Ultimately, the moves have paid dividends as the team has been far and away the most dominant team in North America with a 13-1 record through Week 7 of the 2020 LCS Spring Split.</p>
